## MMoOn curation tooling

This repository ties MMoOn (sub-)repositories together with a Scala/SBT-based
tool to prepare changes in the contained repositories for commits (to keep diffs
small and meaningful) and for release (for CI).

### Sub-Repositories (Submodules)

Sub-repositories to be postprocessed and/or released have been added as 
[Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) that
point to the `release` branch of referred repos.

To get this repo in a working state perform init and update of these 
submodules after cloning via `git submodule update --init --remote`.

Use `git submodule foreach 'git checkout origin/release'` if you want to 
re-sync the sub-repos with the `origin` (i.e. GitHub) state later.

### OWLPod usage

[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org) is used to afford running various configuration
OWLPod that will reformat OWL documents, multiplex to different serialisations and
perform (depending on the chosen configuration), some other refactoring/post-processing
tasks, e.g. materialize RDFS, RDFS+ or OWL DL inferences.

#### available OWLPod configurations

`sbt run` or `sbt runMain ProtegePostprocess`:

Post processes ontology documents in place. It removed declarations to external 
ontologies referred, but not imported (which are automatically added when saving from
Proteg√© Desktop). For Turtle, it also removes (redundant) comment lines, making the
resulting serialisation more compact and readable.
